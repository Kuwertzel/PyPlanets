Some good-to-know things when playing around with this:
  1. I am from germany. If there are words you don't understand (especially commented stuff) you might wanna translate it from german.
  2. I am aware of the fact that my code is quite messy. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I'm happy to help :)
  3. You need to have pygame installed. ...and Python, of course^^
  4. I have a couple of presets for the locations, masses, velocities, etc. of planets. You can find them at line 238+ in the game.py file.
  5. Execute game.py to launch the simulation. module_planet.py is a class that holds the Planet-Object.
  
PS: If someone is interested in the same thing written in JS, just let me know. I'm just too lazy to upload it if noone's ever gonna see it.
